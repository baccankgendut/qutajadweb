Blitzer's net worth and salary?</strong></h2><p>Wolf Blitzer is a German-American journalist and television news anchor who has a net worth of $25 million dollars. Blitzer has been a reporter for CNN since 1990. He is highly regarded for his expertise in U.S. politics as well as international affairs, particularly, in matters of the Middle East.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Wolf Isaac Blitzer was born in Augsburg, Germany on March 22, 1948. He was named Wolf after his maternal grandfather. Wolf's parents, Cesia and David Blitzer, were Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Poland who survived the Holocaust and Auschwitz concentration camp. His maternal grandparents did not survive the war. The family immigrated to the United States after World War II, when Blitzer was just one year old, under the 1948 Displaced Persons Act. From then on, Wolf was raised in Buffalo New York and graduated from Kenmore West Senior High School. Blitzer earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1970. While attending college for his Masters in International Relations at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, he studied abroad and learned Hebrew at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170265 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Wolf-Blitzer.jpg alt="Wolf Blitzer" width=387 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-170265 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>Blitzer started his journalism career with the Reuters news agency in Tel Aviv in the early '70s. He also worked for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee as the editor of their monthly Near East Report. He eventually caught the eye of Jerusalem Post editor Ari Rather and was hired as a Washington correspondent for the English language version of the Israeli newspaper. He worked there, covering both American politics and developments in the Middle East, until 1990. He is fluent in Hebrew and he also published articles in several Hebrew-language newspapers.</p><p>At a White House press conference in April 1977, Blitzer asked Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat why Egyptian scholars, athletes, and journalists were not permitted to visit Israel. Sadat responded that visits would be possible after an "end to the state of belligerence between the two nations." Later that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries that led to the signing of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, "Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook." Blitzer became known for his coverage in the 1986 arrest and trial of Jonathan Pollard, a Jewish American who was charged for spying for Israel. Wolf was the first journalist to interview him and later wrote a book about the trial called "Territory of Lies." Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial due to the legal action against him. Blitzer's book was included on the New York Times list of Notable Books of the Year for 1989.</p><h2 id=cnn><strong>CNN</strong></h2><p>Blitzer joined CNN as the cable network's military affairs reporter in May 1990.

In 1998, Blitzer began hosting the CNN Sunday morning program "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer." The show aired in over 180 countries. His first assignment was as an anchor on the daily newscast "The World Today." From 2000-2005, Blitzer anchored his own show, "Wolf Blitzer Reports."
