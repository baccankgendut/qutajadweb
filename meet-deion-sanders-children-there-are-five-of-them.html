Meet them.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Several people have wondered about Deion Sanders’ children. Who are they? What do they do? Are they living up to their father’s legacy?&nbsp;</p><p>The last question is big because Deion Sanders has large feet, which means his children have big shoes to fill.&nbsp;Keep reading to discover if Deion Sanders’ children are doing just that or better.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-deion1-fotor-20230803171226.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Deion_Sanders></span>Who Is Deion Sanders?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To understand how significant a legacy Deion Sanders’ children will inherit, it is essential to understand how accomplished he is.&nbsp;Deion Sanders is a name everybody knew throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Sanders was nicknamed “Prime Time” as an athlete because of his incredible and sharply-honed abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>This man was so skilled; he had a successful football career and played professional baseball in the MLB.&nbsp;Refusing to pick one, Deion oscillated between the two sports. Thanks to his skill, he got drafted by teams like the Atlanta Falcons, the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Yankees, and the Atlanta Braves.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/deionn.jpg><p>There are records of him participating in an NFL game and an MLB match on the same day. Even today, he is the only athlete to ever appear in both the Super Bowl and the World Series, the highest pinnacles of both sports.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Deion_Sanders_Children></span>Who Are Deion Sanders’ Children?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After he retired as an athlete, Deion Sanders went on to become a coach and also took family life more seriously.&nbsp;He has <a href=#>two ex-wives</a> Carolyn Chambers and Pilar Biggers-Sanders, between whom he has five children named Deiondra, Deion Jr., Shilo, Shedeur, and Shelomi.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Deiondra></span>Deiondra&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn and the former Dallas Cowboys player welcomed their eldest child and first daughter Deiondra on April 17, 1992.&nbsp;She has appeared on TV with her famous father and the rest of their family in two of his self-titled shows on the OWN channel.</p><p>Speaking about how life is as the NFL star’s daughter, she once said: “It was great because…I probably grew up how every kid would want to. That was the great part, the sweet part. It was travelling all the time, meeting celebrities, and we had chefs. The bitter part is that I was always judged at school.”</p><p>Deiondra is now grown up and has a career of her own. She is the director of communications for Sc3 Sports Management. She knows how her father’s influence affects her life but works hard to make a name for herself.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Deion_Jr></span>Deion Jr.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was <a href=#>born</a> on December 1, 1993, to Deion Sanders and Carolyn. He is their second child and the first son.&nbsp;Deion Jr grew up watching his father rise to the top, so it does not come as a surprise that he chose to follow in his football footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p>As a student at Southern Methodist University, he played wide receiver for the Mustangs. However, his love for the game never morphed into a career like his father’s.&nbsp;Today, he no longer pursues football and has a career in fashion. He launched his clothing line in 2016 and is doing well.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shilo></span>Shilo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Deion’s third child and second son came from his former wife, Pilar. He was born on February 9, 2000.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pilar-fotor-20230803171442.jpg><p>Shilo also grew up with an interest in football. In an interview with ESPN about making a name for himself, Shilo said: “If I choose to take that route and follow in my dad’s footsteps, then that’s excellent. But I’m interested in doing my own thing, too, so both could be gratifying.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shedeur></span>Shedeur<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He was born on February 7, 2002, making him Deion’s fourth child and third son. Like his brothers, Shedeur also chose to seek a football career. He is a quarterback for the University of Colorado Boulder’s team, the Buffaloes. He is also very interested in being the best he can be and is more focused on that than on the shoes he has to fill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shelomi></span>Shelomi<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She entered this world on December 14, 2003. Shelomi is Deion’s fifth child and second daughter.&nbsp;Shelomi is also passionate about sports, but unlike her father and brothers, her preferred sport is basketball.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 5, 2022, Shelomi debuted as a player for her college’s basketball team, the JSU Tigers.&nbsp;It is clear she has the passion, but does that mean she’ll end up at the top with the likes of <a href=#>Brittney Griner</a>? Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02abnqGfo3q0rc2dnKurXZi1qrjDq5ynZaSdsrOxjJqpnmWWnsOmec6fZK2glaJ8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ncis-ziva-returns.html>&#171;&nbsp;NCIS Ziva Returns: When does Ziva come back to NCIS?
