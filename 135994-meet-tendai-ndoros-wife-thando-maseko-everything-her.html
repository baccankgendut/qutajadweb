But here are some details about her that other sources have confirmed.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><h3>Thando Maseko’s age</h3><p class=align-left>The estranged wife of Tendai Ndoro will be 39 years of age as of 29 August 2022.</p><h3>Tendai Ndoro and Thando Maseko’s marriage</h3><p class=align-left>B-Metro initially reported that Tendai Ndoro was kicked out of a Kyalami home he shared with his wife following a heated argument, along with claims from her side of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">domestic violence</a>. Source state that she kept his assets like Tendai Ndoro's <a href=#>cars</a> and left him with nothing to his name since the cars and house are allegedly registered in her name.</p>Their source is quoted as saying, 'It appears Ndoro’s property in South Africa is not registered in his name, so when things were not going well with his wife, he was kicked out of their Kyalami Estate home. The biggest mistake he made was not registering the house and cars in his name, and that will be his downfall.'<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1e2b3e1402f190f2.jpg><h3>Thando Maseko's public statements</h3><p class=align-left>However, Thando has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">since come forward</a> and stated that the rumors are not related to her and that much of what some certain sources claim is not true, but the domestic violence reports are accurate.</p>She was allegedly quoted as saying, 'I just wanted to clear the air. On the issue that was posted about me, this lady in the picture is not me. People are mistaking me for the lady Tendai was dating after our marriage ended in 2018. I’ve not seen Tendai since then and I’ve never lived in Kyalami. When I was staying with him, we were in a rented house in Boksburg (in Johannesburg’s East Rand), and he didn’t own that property.'She is further quoted as saying 'During the time l was with Ndoro, we didn’t live the luxurious life people are saying. This was the time when he was having problems with <i>Ajax</i>. They were not paying him, and we were in arrears. We couldn’t even pay rent. The cars that they talk about were not there. We only had one car, and we would fight over who drives it.'<h3>Thando Maseko’s career</h3><p class=align-left>No public information on her career is available as she steers clear from the public eye. Most of what we know regarding her life is based on her marriage to her estranged footballer husband.</p><h3>Tendai Ndoro’s salary</h3><p class=align-left>We do not know what he currently earns as his current job is unknown, but he used to earn an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">R100 000 per month</a> salary at <i>Highlands Park</i>, which was eventually cut down by R20 000.
