While he has appeared in multiple movies, Ben Affleck&nbsp;is likely most well known for his&nbsp;work in both writing and appearing in the 1997 film Good Will Hunting, a film he starred in with his childhood friend <a href=#>Matt Damon</a>. For this film, he received not just a paycheck, but an Academy Award in the Best Original Screenplay category.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ben-Affleck-Matt-Damon-Good-Will-Hunting-1024x576.jpeg><p>Affleck has also done well at the Oscars for movies such as Argo, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and many others. His first major paycheck from a movie came when Affleck starred in Paycheck where he reportedly earned his first $15 million. Once he hit the map at the Oscars, the Affleck net worth would only grow, and his paychecks would with it. He is still a respectable A-lister today.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=the-early-life-of-ben-affleck><strong>The Early Life of Ben Affleck</strong></h2><p>Ben Geza Affleck-Boldt is a California-born actor, born on August 15, 1972, to his father Tim Affleck, and his mother Chris Affleck. The Affleck net worth of this family was a middle-class net worth, with a father as a dreaming playwright and a mom as a school teacher. Until his parent’s divorce, Benjamin Geza Affleck would watch his parents take on every job, carpenter, electrician, janitor, and bookie, to make ends meet so their children could reach their dreams.</p><p>In Massachusetts, Ben Affleck became involved in theatre and performing, and his passion was born. Ben Affleck&nbsp;would not only attend the theatre but would also make friends with those involved. It was here that he met Matt Damon at the age of eight. The two children would dream, grow, and one day become Academy Award winners together.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=the-early-career-of-ben-affleck><strong>The Early Career of Ben Affleck</strong></h2><p>The fortune leading to the Ben Affleck net worth potential began early when Ben appeared in his first big gig, the PBS show Voyage of the Mimi and also the Second Voyage of the Mimi. He would shoot on location in Mexico for the first time. In his teenage years, the Affleck net worth would be topped up with the ABC special “Wanted: A Perfect Man” and the small screen film Hands of a Stranger.</p><p>Ben Affleck went on to graduate from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in the 1990s. By 1991, he had appeared in Daddy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and School Ties in 1992. During this time, he also made multiple television appearances, including appearing in Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story. Affleck was not on the map yet, and the Ben Affleck net worth was still only in the middle-class range for acting, but the Aaron Henry Story work is work that is still talked about today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/do.lolwot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ben-Affleck-Batman-1024x576.jpg><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=ben-affleck-hits-the-map><strong>Ben Affleck Hits the Map</strong></h2><p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon put themselves on the map in Hollywood and across the world with the 1997 film Good Will Hunting. Ben Affleck’s life would never be the same again. Ben Affleck net potential would also never be the same again, a key perk of becoming an Academy Award winner, the most successful outcome of Good Will Hunting for Affleck.</p><p>That outcome wasn’t the original plan. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were given a 40-page assignment in a screenwriting class. They were frustrated with the lack of support in class and were upset that they had given up acting roles for this screenwriting course. It worked out. Years later, they became Academy Award winners instead. When Ben Affleck made it on the map, so did Matt Damon. The production company Pearl Street Films was born, and the Ben Affleck net worth potential would only grow from here.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the only production company for Ben Affleck. Live Planet would become one of his developments later on.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=ben-afflecks-personal-life><strong>Ben Affleck’s Personal Life</strong></h2><p>The personal life of Ben Affleck has been newsworthy for entertainment fans. He was involved with Jennifer Lopez between 2002 and 2004, a time in his life when Ben Affleck’s net worth was enough to purchase a $65 million dollar home. They became engaged early in their relationship but the relationship did not stand the test of time.</p><p>By 2005, Ben Affleck had married Jennifer Garner, whom he had two children with.

Ben Affleck&nbsp;has a trophy shelf to be proud of with two Oscars, 3 Golden Globes, and two BAFTA awards. The first of his two BAFTA Awards from the British Academy for Film came from Good Will Hunting. He also has several Screen Actors Guilds Awards and multiple other credits that have impacted the Ben Affleck net profit margin.</p><p>The biggest paychecks contributing to the Ben Affleck net worth potential have been Good Will Hunting, Reindeer Games, Changing Lanes, and The Sum of All Fears. He has also done very well with Daredevil and Gigli, and also the Deadpool series. &nbsp;For The Sum of All Fears he made $10 million, one of his first big paychecks, but Daredevil earned him $11.5 million and Gigli a cool $12.5 million.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=whats-next-for-ben-affleck><strong>What’s Next for Ben Affleck?</strong></h2><p>The Ben Affleck net worth story will continue, although it is unclear what is next for him. Between his production company, his love of writing, and his talent on screen, the Ben Affleck net worth story will change and grow in time.
