It's hilarious that there was a shock that Gaga was not nominated last year but Alfre not getting nominated was a shocker because she was brilliant and the film doesn't work without her. Mary was fantastic of course but the two of them make the film.</p><p>I'm not a big fan of Scrooged but Alfre, along with Karen Allen, really help ground the film. Murray acts like he's in a completely different film. I find him really off-putting, especially after learning what an asshole he is. But Alfre lights up every scene she's in.</p><p>I felt bad for Alfre that there was no big push for Clemency. I think she would have been nominated.
