It's hilarious that there was a shock that Gaga was not nominated last year but Alfre not getting nominated was a shocker because she was brilliant and the film doesn't work without her. Mary was fantastic of course but the two of them make the film.</p><p>I'm not a big fan of Scrooged but Alfre, along with Karen Allen, really help ground the film. Murray acts like he's in a completely different film. I find him really off-putting, especially after learning what an asshole he is. But Alfre lights up every scene she's in.</p><p>I felt bad for Alfre that there was no big push for Clemency. I think she would have been nominated. It's crazy to think she hasn't received another Oscar nomination in almost 40 years.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 84</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:31 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>at one time she was part of the conversation for Clemency but once again the field was overcrowded with contenders.</p><table class="info small" readability=1.5><tr readability=3><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 85</td><td class=timestamp><span>December 19, 2022 7:34 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I think Alfre was a co-lead in Passion Fish. I would have liked to see her get nominated alongside Mary McDonnell ala Thelma & Louise the year before. Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated for Batman Returns (in supporting or lead, doesn't matter to me). I would have dropped Sarandon in Lorenzo's Oil.
