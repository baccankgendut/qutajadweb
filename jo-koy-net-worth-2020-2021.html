He rose to fame rather late in life, and his primary stand-up topic is the Filipino idiosyncrasies. In 2017 he broke all records when he sold 23,000 tickets for his shows. Eleven shows were completely sold out at the Neal S. Blaisdell Concert Hall in Honolulu. Today he has over 19 lakh followers on Facebook and over 9 lakh on Instagram.</p><p>Maybe you know about Jo Koy very well, but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Jo Koy’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Koy was born in Tacoma on June 2nd, 1971. His father is American, and his mother, a Filipino. Koy’s family was initially settled in Spanaway, but they later moved to Tacoma. Once Koy finished high school, his family moved to Las Vegas to be close to his ailing grandmother.</p><p>Koy attended Spanaway Lake High School originally and then moved to Foss High School in Tacoma. He had enrolled in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, but he dropped out. Koy shared an anecdote on how he got his stage name – in 1989, and his aunt lovingly called him Jo Ko (“ko” means “my” in Tagalog), he mistook it as “koy” and decided to go with the name “Jo Koy.”</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Jo Koy is quite close to his mother and attributes his “Pinoy” comedy to her. She is, in fact, his best muse, for she pops up in his jokes quite often. From her competitive battle with her grandson during a video-game session to her believing “Vicks Vapor Rub” cures almost everything, the stories he weaves around his mother have charmed audiences.</p><p>But Koy has been rather “coy” about his relationships and personal life. Nonetheless, his social life indicates that he has an active dating life, though he carefully guards it at all times.&nbsp; He has a son, Joseph, but he has never opened up about his wife. During his shows, he has referred to her as his “ex-wife” and his “son’s mother.”</p><p>While he has been spotted with several ladies, there was just a brief period when media speculated that he was indeed dating Tia Carrere. But the rumors were stalled as neither party acknowledged the same. In one of his interviews, he said that with his stature and type of work, it is difficult for him to commit to long term relationships. He also prefers to keep his son away from these unnecessary dating rumors and hence his strict stance on keeping mum on the special lady in his life.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 2 June 1971, Jo Koy is 53 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.93 m tall, and his weight is 50 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Jo Koy dropped out of university to become a stand-up comedian and joined a Las Vegas comic drama club in 1994. From there, he moved to open mic night on the show Catch a Rising Star at MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. He also leased the Huntridge Theater and began to perform there, and it was here that he was spotted by an ability facilitator from Los Angeles who offered Koy his first TV breakthrough on BET’s Comic View.</p><p>Koy has starred in TV stand-up specials like Jamie Foxx Presents: Laffapalooza! He has appeared on various VH1 I Love the 7o’s, the 80’s,90’s, Tru TV’s World Dumbest and New Millennium episodes, Amp’d Mobile phone commercials and the Montreal comedy festival Just for Laughs. Now he is a regular guest at Chelsea Handler’s roundtable discussion on E!’s Chelsea Lately and has appeared in over 100 episodes. In 2005, Jo Koy performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He later started a podcast together with comedian and TV host Michael Yo on July 23, 2012, called The Michael Yo and Jo Koy Show.</p><p>After joining the PodcastOne family, he started hosting the weekly podcast, The Koy Pond. Two of Koy’s most successful comedy shows are Comedy Central: Don’t Make Him Angry and Lights Out. But with the advent of Netflix, his third comedy special, Jo Koy: Love from Seattle, which was released on March 28, 2017, worldwide, broke all records and made him a household name.</p><p>Besides his contribution to the world of entertainment, he has started the Jo Koy Foundation. It hosted a philanthropic comedy event on August 4, 2009, called the “Hillary for Charity.” The event took place in Jon Lovitz Comedy Club, located in the heart of Citywalk, Universality, CA, and the proceeds from the sales were donated to the Children’s Hospital of Orange County.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Jo Koy has won the Showtime at the Apollo. He has also won Canada’s prestigious Gemini Award for “Stand-Up Comedian Of The Year” award at the 2018 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal.</p><h2>Net Worth& Salary of Jo Koy in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Jo-Koy-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Jo Koy has a net worth of $2 million. He is one of the top-rated stand-up comedians, and most of his events have been a huge success. In fact, he is the only comedian to sell out six shows at The Warfield in San Francisco. Again at Club Regent Event Centre in Winnipeg, he had four consecutive sold-out shows. More recently, in 2019, Koy sold-out five shows at the San Diego Civic Theatre, breaking the record of the most consecutive sold-out shows for a comedian. He also became the only comedian to sell 17,000+ tickets, over 30 shows (in one year) at the Brea Improv.</p><p>Koy’s onstage presence has been appreciated by viewers. His Filipino jokes have won regional and worldwide viewers. With record-breaking sold-out shows, he is on a roll with his Just Kidding World Tour series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLewecqosGamlal6uLvRrZ9mamBnfW5%2Bj2toaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jon-jones-strong-words-colby-covington.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jon Jones Has Strong Words For Colby Covington</a>
