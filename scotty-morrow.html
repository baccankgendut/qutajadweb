Scott's agent, <a href=#>Frank Ryan</a>, used to promote his client referring to him as "Kid Television" for all the TV appearances he made during that time. In between Scott's illustrious television career a few big screen directors and producers came knocking on his agent's door.</p><p>This was followed with a starring role in a sci-fi thriller The Cosmic Man (1959).</p><p>They ranged from comedy programs like The Donna Reed Show (1958), where he was a recurring cast member playing the role of Pee Wee.</p><p>He was then paired with <a href=#>George Montgomery</a> to co-star in The Toughest Gun in Tombstone (1958).</p><p>That same year, the tear jerker family film, The Heart Is a Rebel (1958) was released featuring Scott opposite <a href=#>Ethel Waters</a>.</p><p>Other comedy shows included Leave It To Beaver - The Lost Episode (1957) and My Three Sons (1960).</p><p>There were the western classics that included Wagon Train (1957), Maverick (1957), Zane Grey Theater (1956), Tales of Wells Fargo, The Restless Gun (1957), Gunsmoke (1955), Shotgun Slade (1959), Buckskin (1958), The Adventures of Kit Carson (1951), and Death Valley Days (1952). And not to be forgotten were the doctor shows like Dr.</p><p>This was followed by An Affair to Remember (1957) for the same studio.</p><p>However, Peyton Place (1957) was acknowledged to be the breakthrough performance in young Scott's film career.</p><p>His very first feature film for MGM was Between Heaven and Hell (1956) followed by Red Sundown (1956) which paved the way for 20th Century-Fox Pictures to cast him in the role of Joey Cross in the epic production of Peyton Place (1957).</p><p>Scotty Morrow was born in Los Angeles, California. He was the product of a show business family. His older brother (Brad Morrow) was an original Disney Mousketeer who himself had an accomplished acting resume. Scott's acting debut occurred at the age of four in a TV commercial for "One A Day" vitamins. That lead to a couple of other commercials followed by some guest appearances on television variety shows such as Red Skelton, Jack Benny, and Johnny Carson. His very first feature role in a TV drama was The United States Steel Hour (1953) in 1955. By the time Scott's childhood acting career was over, he had been featured in over 70 television shows.</p><p>As children, both he and his brother (Brad Morrow) were involved in separate films with Marilyn Monroe. Brad worked with the at-the-time rising star in the film Monkey Business (1952). Scotty was signed to play Marilyn's nephew in a three-part Fox film mystery in the early 1960s, but the film, which had already been in production for about three weeks, ended up shelved due to Marilyn's unreliability (it was close to the end of her life) and disagreements with the producers and Marilyn's agent.</p><p>At the age of 4, his agent (Frank Ryan Agency)chose three last names to consider as a "stage name." They were "Marlowe", "Morrow" and "McMorrow." The latter stemming from a distant relative on his father's side. In 1951, young Scott Mora became 'also known as' Scotty Morrow.</p><p>Scotty Morrow's father was a distant cousin of Dale McMorrow, who was a cousin of Martin Edward Mortensen, who was the birth father of <a href=#>Norma Jeane</a> Mortensen (Marilyn Monroe) as listed on her certified birth certificate. Shortly after the birth, Norma Jeane's mother (Gladys Baker) had it changed to "Baker", the surname of her first husband. In 1946, <a href=#>Norma Jeane</a> started using the name Marilyn Monroe as "Monroe" was her mother's maiden name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqLCwwNOyZKanoqe8uA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-queen-princess-margaret-big-difference-grandchildren.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Queen and Princess Margaret - the big difference between their grandchildren</a>
