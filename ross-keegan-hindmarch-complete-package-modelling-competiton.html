Online</strong>, Ross tells us how he felt posing in his pants and why he's ready to follow in <a class=hm-link href=#>David Gandy</a>'s footsteps.</p><p id=eyAe0-lcbmU data-wc=19><strong>David Gandy started his career on an TV modelling completion, too. Is he someone who you look up to?</strong></p><p id=eB7S5ape4X_A data-wc=39>Yes, definitely. He's a massive icon, a really intelligent bloke; he knows what he's doing. I'd love to meet him one day as well, and hopefully even do shoots with him. I'd definitely like to follow in his footsteps.</p><p id=ejKGYNsZGOn data-wc=7><strong>What advice did Harry Judd give you?</strong></p><p id=e3OeFyq4XnFO data-wc=32>Harry was a proper sport, a great lad and a great laugh. He gave us a few tips like to stay calm and listen to the photographer, he helped us a lot.</p><p id=emkGIP1tFx9 data-wc=8><strong>What was your favourite part of the competition?</strong></p><p id=eZChuQ1y4Aag data-wc=74>When we went from 20 to ten, we had to do a catwalk and introduce ourselves, and that was the first time we did a proper catwalk. Then, when it went from ten to six, we did a beach shoot and we had to get in to small swimming pants. I had to pose with a model, and obviously I've never done that before so it was a bit nerve-wracking but it was fun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b7229196dce-david-gandy-a.jpg><p id=efjpTY3dkyi data-wc=8><strong>What do you do to keep in shape?</strong></p><p id=e2jz9gwLCQBm data-wc=52>Fitness-wise I change it a lot. I think the best way is to change it up every six weeks, because once your mind gets bored your body is just going to follow. So I'll lift heavy [weights] for about six weeks, and then change to lifting lighter ones but with higher reps.</p><p id=eJwdxmmN0Chd data-wc=8><strong>Do you keep a really healthy diet, too?</strong></p><p id=el6Sd-fDtY6R data-wc=58>I've never really dieted before until this competition, but over the last six weeks I've been sticking to a really strict diet. I've slimmed down; I've lost a stone within a month and a bit. I just wanted to win, so I just did everything I possibly could. I left no stone unturned and absolutely went for it.</p><p id=e8v_ubAI3GLp data-wc=9><strong>How did you feel about posing half-naked on screen?</strong></p><p id=eGkJRexwV510 data-wc=31>When they weren't doing it live and they were just filming it, it was alright, but when it went live it was quite scary. But it was really fun as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/553fad89c970-ross-2-a.jpg><p id=e0nelM57AUke data-wc=16><strong>Did you get on well with the other guys in the competition, or were you rivals?</strong></p><p id=eskHwdzF5NR4 data-wc=44>There's always going to be rivalry, but we stuck together. We're like brothers, especially me, Tom and Sam, the last three. We got on like a house on fire, they're such good lads, and hopefully they'll go on to do really well as well.</p><p id=e41vkkvdYAFo data-wc=10><strong>How did you get into modelling in the first place?</strong></p><p id=eslmL9dFGJmI data-wc=43>I'd never really thought about it before until my mate said I should go for the completion, but I've always liked the idea of being in front of a camera. I enjoy the acting, playing roles and stuff; it's not just taking pictures.</p><p id=eYytI1Wpkpu1 data-wc=10><strong>Did you have a day job before entering the competition?</strong></p><p id=e3_kR0oniUq2 data-wc=64>Yeah I'm in the Royal Navy! I've been doing that for four years, I joined when I was 16. Although it's great and I've done so many things there, and they've done a lot for me, I feel like it's time to move on and try other things. I was already on transitional leave from the Navy, and it's great that this came up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0f990141d657-ross-complete-package-z.jpg><p id=eZ5I127e5amR data-wc=8><strong>What do your family think of it all?</strong></p><p id=eyQSYzws78UJ data-wc=48>Everyone's going crazy at the moment, I can't get a word in. I go on Facebook and everyone's trying to speak to me, all my family and friends, everyone is so pleased for me. It's great. I've got a girlfriend and she's massively supportive too, so that helps.</p><p id=e1jAOjAFPv6W data-wc=5><strong>What is next for you?</strong></p><p id=e-xfws61F0fR data-wc=51>From here I'm going to Paris to do a campaign for underwear, which will be really exciting. I've never been to Paris before so I'm buzzing, I can't wait to go. I'm still taking it all in, I'm still shocked! Words can't describe it; obviously the future's going to be bright.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2prYWV%2Bcn2UaWltZ6KkwLR5yp6coJmeYrWqusOmmKubmGKwsLnPpZytnV2lrqS3wKCcZqWfmbKtuMinnmabn6K9psDIraanZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./inside-royal-dining-rooms-photos-the-queen-prince-charles.html>&#171;&nbsp;13 incredible royal dining rooms used by the Queen, Prince Charles and more</a>
