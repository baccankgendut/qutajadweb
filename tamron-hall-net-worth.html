She was raised by her mother, Mary Newton, and stepfather, Clarence Newton Sr. Tamron had an older sister named Renate Moore (Clarence's daughter) who was murdered in 2004 after years of abusive relationships. As of this writing, Renate's murder has not been officially solved, and Hall spoke to "People" magazine about the tragedy in 2016, stating, "No one deserves what happened to my sister. For a long time I was hesitant about sharing our story. I didn't want to be another well-known person saying, 'Look what happened to me and my family.' But then I said, 'Screw that. I can save a life.'" Tamron attended Temple University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Broadcast Journalism in 1992, then she moved to Texas for her broadcasting career.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After working as a general assignment reporter at KBTX in Bryan, Texas, Hall took the same position at KTVT in Fort Worth in 1994. In 1997, she was hired by WFLD-TV in Chicago, and she stayed there for a decade, working as a consumer reporter, general assignment reporter, and host of "Fox News in the Morning."

On the show, Hall "interviews those most deeply affected and visits the scene of the crime to find out what really happened and why."

The couple welcomed son Moses Mitchell Hall Greener in April 2019. In 2014, as part of the "Shine A Light" campaign, each "Today" anchor chose a cause to support that year. Hall chose domestic abuse and raised more than $40,000 for Day One New York, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to "end dating abuse and domestic violence through community education, supportive services, legal advocacy and leadership development." Tamron dedicated her Investigation Discovery show, "Deadline: Crime," to her older sister, and she told "The Grio" in 2013, "My sister's case has led me to focus a lot of my attention on domestic violence. We don't know what happened in her case, what I do know is that she was found in a swimming pool in the back of her home, face down, and it was ruled a homicide. My journey to speak out on domestic violence was based on conversations that I had with my sister." In 2014, Hall was honored with Safe Horizon's Voice of Empowerment award, and the organization collaborated with her on The Tamron ❤ Renate Fund, which helps victims of domestic violence "find support as well as a place for friends and family to find resources." Tamron received an Honorary Doctorate from Peirce College in 2016, and she is a member of the nonprofit organization the National Association of Black Journalists.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Hall has earned three Daytime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Informative Talk Show Host for "Tamron Hall," winning in 2020.

Murrow Award for a "powerful story on domestic violence."
