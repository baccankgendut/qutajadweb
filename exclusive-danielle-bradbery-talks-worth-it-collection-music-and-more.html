style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Danielle Bradbery is one of the most exciting country singers on the scene at the moment and the US singer has recently teamed up with ABLE to launch her debut Worth It collection which takes it name from Bradbery’s hit single and features stunning jewellery.</p><p>Here we speak to Danielle Bradbery about her female strong music, new accessories line, upcoming UK shows and much, much more;</p><p><strong>Being a strong female in the music industry do you think your platform allows you to be a voice for a new generation?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Absolutely!! If it’s inspiring others, count me in!!! I know we will all continue to put out inspiring messages for everyone to feel motivated and excited!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your music is all about female empowerment, especially ‘Worth It’, what is your message to rising female artists?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes, if I can inspire others to feel powerful, then I will. My message to rising female artists is to be yourself and feel confident about it! As long as you’re true to yourself and you’re having fun, then it goes a long way!</p><p></p><p><strong>You released your sophomore album ‘<a href=#>I Don’t Believe We’ve Met</a>‘ last year, how do you feel your sound has evolved since your debut release?</strong></p><p>My sound has changed a lot. My first record came out right after I won The Voice and I wasn’t a songwriter yet. I took some time off after that experience to lay low and start songwriting. It’s a really therapeutic process. I found out a lot about myself, and I just was very honest in my stories on my second record.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You found fame on The Voice, do you think being a part of the show shaped the artist you are today?</strong></p><p>Yes!! I felt like The Voice was an industry boot camp. It gave you a little taste of lights, camera, action!! I know my confidence level went up throughout that show and I’m very thankful for that because I was a very shy girl. So, I thank The Voice for that almost every day haha!!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Along with making waves in the US, you’re also playing festivals over here in the UK this year how excited are you to be coming to Britain?</strong></p><p>I’m very very excited!!! I love adventures and seeing amazing places, especially being able to share my music with people over there. I’m very happy I’m coming to Britain!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are there any UK country acts you’d like to work with?</strong></p><p>I think it’d be cool to do something that crosses over, out of genre. I would love to do something with Adele or Harry Styles. That would be so awesome.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What can your UK fans expect from your live shows?</strong></p><p>They can expect fun and honesty! I’ve been playing my new album and it has been so exciting to see the reaction. The first time I played in the UK, I was blown away from how amazing the fans were!! They were already singing every word. I’m pumped to be coming back!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have any plans for a full UK tour soon?</strong></p><p>–It comes up in our meetings a lot. Right now I’m doing some festivals and opening for Thomas Rhett later this year. I’d love to do my own full tour one day!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Can we also expect new music from you soon?</strong></p><p>I’ve been focusing a lot of my time promoting “I Don’t Believe We’ve Met” but I have started writing again. Its such a fun process for me that I never really stop.</p><p><strong>Along with working on new music you have also recently released your debut accessories line, with ABLE how did that come about?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes!! ABLE is such an awesome company, and I’m so honoured&nbsp;to be partnering with them. All the women that make the jewellery&nbsp;are women who have overcome large obstacles in their lives. I felt like my song, “Worth It” was a really good reminder for them that they are worthy of everything they have and aspire for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the inspiration behind the collection?</strong></p><p>I wrote this song because I had a hard time standing up for myself. When I started playing the song in my shows, I realised&nbsp;that so many people could relate to it. So the collection is really a reminder to know your self worth, stand up for yourself, and be confident. The collection consists of a bracelet, necklace, ring, and leather wallet.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve partnered with <a href=#>@livefashionABLE</a> to create a <a href=#>#WorthIt</a> line available now! The spirit of the incredible females at ABLE inspired me immediately & seeing them wear the items with pride was a moment I’ll never forget. Can’t wait to see them on y’all too!! <a href=#>https://t.co/qjBA7cavlY</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/08V9nC4ZUP</a></p><p>— Danielle Bradbery (@DBradbery) <a href=#>April 25, 2018</a></p><p><strong>Were you involved in the whole designing process?</strong></p><p>I was. I wanted the line to be pieces I would actually wear. ABLE already had these rings, but they let me pick out which ones I like the best to put my message on. I usually prefer simplicity in the jewellery&nbsp;I wear, and these are very clean, dainty pieces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your favourite piece from the collection?</strong></p><p>I personally love the “Worth It” rings!! I love rings in general and the fact that this has a message that I need to be reminded of is even better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What message do you hope to project via the line?</strong></p><p>I hope it makes others feel confident and reminds them that they’re not alone when they don’t feel 100%. We all have bumps in the road that we are all dealing with, so why not overcome them together!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Was the message and work of ABLE important to your choice of teaming up with them?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. It’s how I knew about them to begin with. I wanted to be part of sharing what they were doing.</p><p><strong>Along with your accessories collection, and festival slots what else can fans expect from you this year?</strong></p><p>More shows, more videos, more fun collaborations. I’ve got a lot cooking right now and I’m so excited to share it with my fans!&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you follow Danielle Bradbery on Twitter <a href=#>@DBradbery</a> to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Danielle Bradbery?
